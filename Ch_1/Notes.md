# Chapter 1 notes

# Anatomy of a program
Source File >> Class >> Methods >> Statements

# What can be done INSIDE a method
1. Do something
2. Do something again and again
3. Do something only under a condition

# Things to think about in a class?
1. Things the object KNOWS ----- "INSTANCE VARIABLES"
2. Things the object DOES ------ "METHODS"

# Example :Alarm
1. Knows : time, mode
2. Does : setAlarmTime(), getTime(), isAlarmSet(), snooze()

# DOG
1. Breed, Color
2. bark()

# Dot operator
Dog.bark()
Use the thing before the dot to get to the point AFTER the dot

# Object creation and assignment

Dog tommy = new Dog()
tommy is a remote control that only turns on the TV dog. (tommy)
create space for a new dog object on the heap (new Dog)
connect the remote control to the tv (=)

A reference variable value is the bits representing a way to get to an object on the heap.
